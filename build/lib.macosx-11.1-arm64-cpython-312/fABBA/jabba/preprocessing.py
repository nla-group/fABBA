    Transform texts/symbols to numerical values
    
    This package provide various essential tools to transform symbols data into numerical data.
    Each symbolic sequence in the dataset might be of various length, hence we provide the 
    ``pad_sequence`` method to unify the length of each instance. The package offers numerous API
    like ``BOW_encode``, ``categorical_encode``, ``one_hot_encode``, and ``tfidf_encode`` to transform
    the symbolic sequence to the vector representations. Additionally, you can transform the symbolic 
    data in n-grams form with ``n_gram_build``.
